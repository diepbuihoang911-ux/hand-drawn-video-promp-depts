# 🖍️ Hand-Drawn Video Prompts

### Turn voiceover scripts into consistent 9:16 modern chibi crayon-doodle image and image-to-video prompts.

An open-source AI Skill designed for AI explainers, financial commentary, tech insights, and educational short-form creators. Automatically breaks copy into 4–6 second semantic shots, visual metaphors, English Flow / Nano Banana image prompts, video motion prompts, and embedded hand-drawn keywords—eliminating style drift and subtitle clashes.

## ✨ Key Features

- ⏱️ **4–6 Second Semantic Shot Breakdown**: Cuts shots by logical argument beats, rhetorical pacing, and narrative emotion rather than arbitrary word counts.
- 🖍️ **Modern Chibi Crayon Doodle Aesthetic**: Fixed `#F8F6EF` warm off-white fine paper texture, thick imperfect ink lines, and classic sunflower yellow / cobalt blue / tomato red accents.
- 🎬 **Dual Prompt Delivery (Still Image + Video Motion)**: Outputs ready-to-copy English image prompts and image-to-video motion prompts for Flow and Nano Banana.
- ✍️ **Embedded Hand-Drawn Keywords**: Short Chinese/English keywords drawn directly onto paper or objects as part of the illustration, strictly reserving bottom space for subtitles.
- 🧑‍💼 **Chibi Tech & Business Caricatures**: Transforms recognizable public figures (e.g., Musk, Jensen Huang, Zuckerberg) into expressive chibi cartoon avatars using safe visual anchors.
- 🎯 **Layered Entity Accuracy**: Provides guidance on flags, logos, numbers, and long text, separating generation from deterministic post-production overlays.

### 🎬 Shot 01: Tech Giants GPU Arms Race
> **Source Narration**: "The four tech giants spent $200B on GPUs in a single year, but Wall Street is asking: where is the real return?"  
> **Suggested Duration**: 5 seconds  
> **Visual Metaphor**: Four chibi tech executives pushing wheelbarrows piled with glowing microchips toward a steep peak, under a giant magnifying glass held by a hand in the sky.  
> **On-Image Keyword**: "2000亿" ($200B)

[Flow Image Prompt]
Modern minimalist crayon doodle illustration, vertical 9:16, warm off-white fine-textured paper background #F8F6EF, thick imperfect black ink outlines. Four cute expressive chibi tech executives in simple business attire pushing wheelbarrows piled high with glowing GPU microchips toward a steep mountain peak. In the clean upper sky, a giant whimsical hand with a gold ring holds a magnifying glass inspecting them. Warm sunlight yellow, cobalt blue, tomato red accents. Hand-drawn Chinese text "2000亿" naturally written in black crayon on the side of a wheelbarrow. Clear composition with generous negative space, empty clean area at bottom reserved for subtitles.

[Flow Image-to-Video Prompt]
Gentle 2D hand-drawn stop-motion animation. The four chibi executives strain forward cheerfully pushing their wheelbarrows, wheels wobbling slightly. The magnifying glass in the sky pans smoothly from left to right as a beam of warm light highlights the glowing chips. Tiny paper-grain particles float subtly in the air. Fixed #F8F6EF background color with zero flicker.

## 🛠️ Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[1. Paste Narration / Script] --> B[2. Skill Decomposes 4-6s Shots & Metaphors]
    B --> C[3. Output Flow / Nano Prompts]
    C --> D[4. Generate Still & Video Clips]
    D --> E[5. Align Subtitles & Audio in Editor]
```

1. **Input Script**: Paste a 30–60 second voiceover script.
2. **Semantic Breakdown**: Skill analyzes logic, assigns pacing, designs metaphors, and selects keywords.
3. **Get Dual Prompts**: Generates English image prompts (with `#F8F6EF` paper lock) and video motion prompts.
4. **Generate Media**: Paste into Flow / Nano Banana to generate still frames; use still as Last Frame and blank `#F8F6EF` paper as First Frame.
5. **Assemble**: Import to CapCut / Premiere to stitch clips and auto-align captions.
